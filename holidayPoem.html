motivated to work<br>
i'm also wearing my new training shoes<br>
joyful to lift weights again<br>
<br>
Feeling bored again, I picked up my watercolors,<br>
creative ideas rushed inside my head<br>
I blend some coffee and put it in my mug<br>
relaxed, i drink it as I lay down some colors using my paint brush<br>
<br>
Satisfied with my work, i layed my eyes on some bond papers<br>
dumbdounded, i caught myself smiling<br>
as i remember how i got it together with a correction tape<br>
i suddenly felt sad, longing for my teammates<br>
<br>
I went to bed and lay on the new pillow i got<br>
feeling tired, i closed my eyes<br>
i reached out for my teddy bear<br>
suddenly my heart is breaking as i remember the person who gave it to me<br>

It felt like I was in dessert land, I was happy<br>
And then came beauty products from my classmates<br>
They were nice to use, I feel remembered<br>
A mug from my class adviser too<br>
I was actually surprised, an unexpected end for the party<br>
And then it was time to leave for vacation<br>
 I overall felt excited<br>
But celebrating Christmas differently with bonbons<br>
Made me feel a sense of longingness <br>
Family isn&rsquo;t complete, but I received new shirts and shoes<br>
Though its not the same, Its just sad<br>
But even though it was like that, New Year&rsquo;s was spent with food<br>
I was back with my family, and I felt complete<br>

so and so as it may seem <br>
a weary o&rsquo;l jacket of all nothingness<br>
could bring such and so for so much longingness<br>
oh how memory sees all that&rsquo;s hiding silliness<br>
<br>
wonder oh wonder what I got for Christmas<br>
a pair of pants, a shirt, or maybe some earphones<br>
or could it be that I get the happiness inside<br>
that would fill me whole in a night of spiritful <br>
<br>
is it money, or drinks, or just for the hell of it<br>
or to clothe the undeniable loneliness deep inside <br>
my depression is nothing of an open book<br>
hoping you'd see it, as my problem, my maelstrom, my journey <br>

My Gifts at Christmas <br>
Mug that I Received that was a surprise<br>
Made me warm at Christmas week<br>
Neck Pillow from my Best friend <br>
Made sleeping anywhere, comfortable<br>
Candies so sweet <br>
It made my heart flutter a bit<br>
New mouse that I always wanted<br>
Made me happier than before<br>
Correction Tape from a friend<br>
Sad that not all mistakes can be redone<br>
Money from parents <br>
Made me happy as I can be<br>
Cologne that smelled good<br>
Also made me feel good<br>
All these things that I received<br>
Made me feel loved cared and valued<br>

First things first, a sock of happiness<br>
Keeping me comfy and warm, even when alone<br>
A mug in hand to start the day<br>
Given by a friend to make each day joyous<br>
<br>
Then, a sweater from a companion<br>
To fit my fashion, or to fit my mood<br>
And suddenly, chocolates simple and plain<br>
Although common, surprised for their mindful<br>
<br>
As the holidays pass, money is saved<br>
From people that remember, and so I am thankful<br>
Not only that an accidental belt<br>
Keeping me together, confused with the events<br>
<br>
Communication at hand, a new phone emerges<br>
No setups, no plans, just pure emotion<br>
And to end the holidays, a pair of shorts<br>
For something new, while nothing moves<br>

Memories of Christmas kept in an SD card<br>
I start to feel content<br>
As ink seeps through journal pages<br>
Filled with the happy thoughts of today<br>
<br>
Soon I start to feel like a decorative mug<br>
Empty, unloved, and gathering dust<br>
With the distant scratches of colored pencils on paper as a lullaby<br>
My eyes drooping as I grow tired<br>
<br>
Sketchbook pages flipping from the breeze<br>
I stir awake, still sleepy<br>
But my hand flies to the necklace around my neck<br>
And I breathe to dispel this anxious feeling<br>
<br>
Notebook filled to the brim with words<br>
That reflect on the sadness that I feel<br>
Soon feeling fuzzy like a socks on feet<br>
I fall back to slumber, warmth seeping into my thought

Holiday Gifts<br>
My perfume with sweet and strong scent<br>
Every spray is full of excitement <br>
With these blue-colored shirts <br>
Where should I go, I&rsquo;m free<br>
<br>
A pair of long iconic socks<br>
Every step is comfortable <br>
These jeans are perfect fit<br>
Looking good, but I&rsquo;m still worried<br>
<br>
New black earphones that I received <br>
Brings more joy to my ears<br>
Trying these blue polo that I got<br>
Really nice but awkward<br>
<br>
Watching a movie with my eyeglasses<br>
Without the fear of time passing<br>
As I eat these chocolate cookies <br>
Spending my holidays happily

Noche Buena , fireworks , the whole starter pack<br>
Receiving such gifts, under the tree, in a stack<br>
My mum got me a bag , it had a letter in it too<br>
She wrote an unexpected &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A mug from our homeroom teacher <br>
Unexpected as can be <br>
It was such a thoughtful gift from a trip <br>
As it was personalized for me<br>
<br>
My sisters got me a Bible and some sweatpants<br>
Turns out the suspected reason was more wholesome but I was right<br>
They wanted us to pray as family<br>
And the pants were a gift because it was too tight<br>
<br>
I got a notebook from Ally<br>
Socks from Clarmars and a pen from Dan <br>
All became unexpected friends <br>
Such was the appreciation from my school fam<br>
<br>
This Christmas was a feels trip <br>
To be very honest<br>
I was morose with a side of sorrows<br>
Didn&rsquo;t think my emotions could infest <br>
<br>
Having received more than gifts<br>
Being more loved than I deserved<br>
The house felt home-y<br>
And Christmas did NOT feel lonely<br>

Yuletide season, here are thou<br>
&lsquo;Tis the season to give as they say<br>
Several gifts I receive, tied in a lovely bow<br>
<br>
Here comes the coffee mug<br>
All glossy and shiny making me feel the cold season chill<br>
Its bestfriend, the picture frame is never out of log<br>
All boring for some but sentimental for me <br>
All pink and dainty comes the make up<br>
Making me feel all pretty and dolly<br>
<br>
There comes the gems from Tiffany&rsquo;s<br>
A girl&rsquo;s adoration, and a woman&rsquo;s happiness<br>
Something new, comes the nail polish <br>
A perfect compliment to a darling&rsquo;s weakness<br>
Never absent, never overrated, food for thee <br>
Heavenly for the nose and yummy for the tummy<br>
<br>
All underrated but oh so lovely letter<br>
Make the season real meaningful<br>
For love truly is the best offer<br>
&lsquo;Tis the season for love and meaning for us, fools<br>

My new red shoes look really good<br>
It is truly beautiful, but it&rsquo;s still a little awkward<br>
With some new socks, I need to break them in<br>
But even before I walk, I got worried about my heels<br>
<br>
With my balm stained lips, where will I go? Where will it take me?<br>
Half fear, half excitement<br>
Should I take my charm bracelet with me?<br>
Even it&rsquo;s only a downhill after this uphill, I&rsquo;m still so curious<br>
<br>
These pants look great, I&rsquo;ll walk, then stop, then run with it<br>
Then I&rsquo;ll stand there merrily!<br>
Then someday, just like my glasses<br>
It&rsquo;ll become comfortable, I&rsquo;ll get used to it<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ll try it with these shoelaces<br>
Making paths where there are no paths, I&rsquo;m ecstatic<br>
With my new rose fragrance, where will I go? Where will it take me?<br>
I truly wonder <br>

Holidays are here again<br>
Food, gatherings, and gifts to spare<br>
Picture frame, on top of list once again<br>
Another one to stock on fare<br>
<br>
Gaming gears, my favorite<br>
Making my heart skip a beat <br>
A mousepad for my poor wrist<br>
The best gift ever on my list<br>
<br>
A coffee mug for my hot drink<br>
Shoo-ing the cold weather to brink<br>
A t-shirt from my pretty mother<br>
So in looking for outfits, I won&rsquo;t bother<br>
<br>
A pair of shoes from my dad<br>
Making me wanna go out and be rad<br>
Some cash from my godparents<br>
To keep me loaded for merry sent<br>
<br>
Some chocolates from my dearest friends<br>
Surely, happiness it sends<br>
Those are all the gifts I received<br>
So in the season of merry, I believed<br>

ith these shoelaces<br>
Making paths where there are no paths, I&rsquo;m ecstatic<br>
With my new rose fragrance, where will I go? Where will it take me?<br>

Rings that are shiny that now hug my fingers <br>
Which I intertwine to those of my lover's <br>
Mug that is fragile, it slips and it shatters <br>
So I hold it tight like my family's honor <br>
<br>
Soft and fluffy thick woolen sweater <br>
More than enough to warm up December<br>
Chocolates I stuff my mouth with seems kind of bitter <br>
But full it could leave me and there&rsquo;s more for later <br>
<br>
Coffee grounds in a bright red canister <br>
It's what keeps me calm and refrain from my anger <br>
Jaw-dropping handsome, the man in the poster <br>
Makes me so grateful for my older sister <br>
<br>
That brings us to the mouth-watering dinner <br>
Which in preparing, I'm proud I helped mother <br>
In return I got to see my family's presence together <br>
I felt content as I hear them all chatter<br>

A friend gave me a usb<br>
64gb I was so happy<br>
I also received a wallet<br>
Without no money, I felt disappointed<br>
<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s jolly because of the food<br>
I ate all of it &lsquo;til my heart&rsquo;s full<br>
Chocolates I will forever miss<br>
An ecstasy that&rsquo;s sweet like a kiss<br>
<br>
Lego keychains that are hanging<br>
Like the socks that made us go swinging<br>
The clothes outside that are dangling<br>
Gleefully dances in tune with our singing<br>
<br>
The scent of perfume&rsquo;s like a bliss<br>
Gives memories for me to reminisce<br>
It really was a time worth remembering<br>
Cause in the end they gave me money<br>
Now happiness is truly within me<br>

'Tis the season to be jolly<br>
The people are truly driven<br>
They laugh and sing and dance with folly<br>
With the thought of the gifts they'll be given<br>
<br>
I have received gifts, in this fine night<br>
  Like cards, socks and candy<br>
  My happiness rushed in such might<br>
  For I was truly merry <br>
  <br>
  The first gift I did receive <br>
  Was a pair of festive socks<br>
  The comfort was something I couldn't believe<br>
  And I decided that it rocks<br>
  <br>
  The next gifts my friends gave me<br>
  Were candies that stimulated my senses<br>
  There were chocolates, gummy worms, and a lolly<br>
  So for that, I had forgiven their offenses<br>
  <br>
  The best gift I received this Christmas night<br>
  Were the people that I truly love<br>
  I swear that they will never leave my sight<br>
  For they were given by our God above<br>

I got a tshirt last december<br>
I was so happy i could remember<br>
And a jacket thats gray<br>
For a moment i was gay<br>
I also got a mug designed with skies<br>
For a moment i was in surprise<br>
And then i received briefs<br>
Then i accept it with grief<br>
But it comes with money<br>
Then I became jolly <br>
I then received a wallet <br>
I exlaimed, &quot;can i have it?&quot;<br>
I received a cap saying,<br>

Next to it are socks, all colored and thick<br>
Curing the cold so no more sick<br>

For each year it appears for the cold not to be a bother<br>
Their cousin, the sweater is never absent<br>
For it expresses the merry in this season of sentiment<br>
A flat box I see, contains colorful paint<br>
Calling me to express and show all the daint<br>

One tuesday morning when I saw a white pillow,<br>
Memories suddenly flashed filled with happiness<br>
I plug my earphones in to feel its essence<br>
As excitement poured all over our faces for presents <br>
<br>
I look into the mirror with a face mask <br>
Paired with my lazy and sleepy eyes,<br>
And a dead broken phone on my right hand,<br>
Because of a tiring and long night <br>
<br>
I opened a palette with colors of beauty<br>
That comes with amusing history<br>
I walk and walk with white shoes<br>
Feeling bored and drained as obvious as it looks<br>
<br>
Lilies and sweetness, a perfume just like mine<br>
I am grateful and thankful for all what I have<br>
Here I am, wrapped in a blanket and I prayed<br>
I am blessed, and so are you, let's hit the hay<br>
